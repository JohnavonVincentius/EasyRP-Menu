# EasyRP-Menu
This is a addon for the EasyRP By Pizzabelly At :https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP
This just adds a simple menu for setting the configuration file,in the menu there is also a couple of preset that you can change.
To use this Menu,You Must have python and the list of library:
-Tkinter
-ConfigParser
-Time
-Math
-Subprocess
-os
(Most of them is probaby installed by python,but if you don't have it,you can download it on google)
You also need to set up the EasyRP,Check it out at :https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP

If this is your first time using EasyRP,then you need to register a Rich Presence application with discord at : https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
There you need to make a new application (The name of the app will correspond to the name for the RP(Rich Presence))
Then You will need to copy the ClientID and also you need to import some assets(Remember the name of the assets since you might need to change the code a little)
once you got the assets in there,you can open up the EasyRP-Windows and you will find the config.ini file,open it and replace the ClientID with your ClientID that you copied.

Thats it,if you installed python correctly and have all the librarys you should see a simple menu that will set your Rich Presence On Discord.You can play with it.

For the presets
The large Image for Zoom is "zoom",The small Image is "zooms"
The Large Image For Minecraft is "minecraft", the small image is "diamond"

A Couple of Note:
For the preset Zoom and Minecraft:
  Size is the number of user that you want to set(It doesn't check the entry,so you could also put words in it)
  Max is the number max of user that you want to set(again it doesnt check the entry so the value could be lower than the Size and you could put words in it)
for Minecraft:
  World just displays the world you play in.
for custom status:
  SI Text is the Small Image Text
  LI Text is the Large Image Text
  L Img is the name of the large image (the name of the asset)
  S Img is the name of the small image (again the name of the asset)
For the button,The Update button just updates the entrys,but doesn't reset the time

Thats it,have fun with the menu!!
